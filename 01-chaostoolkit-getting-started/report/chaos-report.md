At this point you would usually run a chaos experiment to produce a report, but for this tutorial we're only interested in the final step of the `discover`->`init`->`run`->`report` workflow in Chaos Tool,it so instead we'll create a representative output from the `chaos run` command that you can then use to report on.

The contents of the output from the `chaos run` command will be the following. Copy this into the `chaos-report.json` file so you can then use it:

Now that you have the raw experimental output that would normally be produced by the `chaos run` command, you can take this and produce a report in a given format by executing the following:

`chaos report --export-format=html5 chaos-report.json report.html`{{execute}}

This will produce a `.html` format version of the report. The `--export-format` option selects the output that you want, the next parameter is the source, raw report file that came from `chaos run`, and the final parameter is the filename of the report that you would like to product.

Optionally, to produce a great-looking `pdf` export you can execute the following:

`chaos report --export-format=pdf chaos-report.json report.pdf`{{execute}}
