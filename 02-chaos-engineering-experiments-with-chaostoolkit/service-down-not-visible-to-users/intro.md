This tutorial will build a simple microservice-based system using Kubernetes and then show how you can explore that system using Chaos Engineering to discover and overcome a weakness in the form of a cascading failure.

All of the sample code for this tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit-samples/tree/master/service-down-not-visible-to-users).
